/*PROBLEM #3: SWAP Two Numbers (With & Without Temp Variable)
=============================================================================
##What Does "SWAP" Mean?
-------------------------
Swapping means exchanging the values of two variables.
Real-Life Example:
Imagine two glasses:

Glass A has Orange Juice 
Glass B has Apple Juice 

Goal: Exchange their contents!
After swapping:

Glass A has Apple Juice 
Glass B has Orange Juice 
===============================================================================
##The Problem:-
---------------
Before Swap:  |   After Swap:
   a = 10     |     a = 20
   b = 20     |     b = 10

==============================================================================
##Common MISTAKE (This Won't Work!):------

a = b;  // Now a = 20, b = 20
b = a;  // Now a = 20, b = 20


#What went wrong?
-------------------

Step 1: a = b
        a = 20, b = 20  ❌ (Original value of a is LOST!)

Step 2: b = a
        a = 20, b = 20  ❌ (Both have same value!)


The original value of a (which was 10) is gone forever!
