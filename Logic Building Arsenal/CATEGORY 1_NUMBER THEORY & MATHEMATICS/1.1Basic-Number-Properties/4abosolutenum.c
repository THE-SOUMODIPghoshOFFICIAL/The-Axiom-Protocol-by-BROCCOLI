==========================================================================
 ##Visual Understanding on Number Line:-

      ←─────────────|─────────────→
        -5  -4  -3  -2  -1  0  1  2  3  4  5
    
   |-5| = 5  (distance from 0 is 5 units)
   |5|  = 5  (distance from 0 is 5 units)
   |0|  = 0  (distance from 0 is 0 units)
