/* PROBLEM #2: Check if Number is POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or ZERO
===================================================================
Mathematical Concept
Numbers can be divided into 3 categories based on their value:
1. POSITIVE Numbers (> 0)

Greater than zero
Examples: 1, 2, 5, 100, 9999
On number line: RIGHT side of zero

2. NEGATIVE Numbers (< 0)

Less than zero
Examples: -1, -5, -100, -9999
On number line: LEFT side of zero

3. ZERO (= 0)

Neither positive nor negative
The middle point
Only ONE number in this category!*/
