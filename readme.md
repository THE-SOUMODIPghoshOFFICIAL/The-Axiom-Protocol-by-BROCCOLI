## 🗺️ The Protocol (Roadmap)

<details>
<summary><strong>View the Roadmap</strong> — click to expand/collapse</summary>

This protocol is segmented into distinct phases, tracking the progression from basic concepts to advanced application.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundational Syntax & Concepts** (Current)
  - [ ] Variables, Data Types, and Operators
  - [ ] Control Flow (If, Else, Switch)
  - [ ] Loops (For, While, Do-While)
  - [ ] Functions and Scope
- [ ] **Phase 2: Core C Mechanics**
  - [ ] Pointers and Memory Management
  - [ ] Arrays and Strings
  - [ ] Structs, Unions, and Enums
  - [ ] File I/O
- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Structures & Algorithms**
  - [ ] Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - [ ] Trees and Graphs
  - [ ] Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- [ ] **Phase 4: Advanced Tooling & Graphics**
  - [ ] Makefiles and Build Systems
  - [ ] External Libraries (e.g., SDL, OpenGL)
  - [ ] Basic 2D Graphics Rendering
- [ ] **Phase 5: The 3D Engine**
  - [ ] Vector & Matrix Math
  - [ ] 3D Model Loading
  - [ ] The Render Pipeline
  - [ ] Shaders and Lighting

<h2 id="-project-structure">🗂️ Project Structure</h2>

<p>The repository in this workspace is organized by topic, with each folder corresponding to a phase in the protocol.</p>

<pre>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><code>01_the_Basics/</code></b>: Contains source files and examples covering foundational C/C++ syntax used throughout Phase 1.</li>
    <li><em>As the protocol advances, additional phase folders (e.g. `02_Core_Mechanics/`) will be created in the root.</em></li>
  </ul>
</p>
## 💻 Compiling & Running

Each module is self-contained. To compile and run a specific piece of code:

1.  Navigate into the module's directory:
    ```bash
    cd 01_the_Basics/some_concept_folder
    ```
2.  Compile the C file using `gcc` (or any C compiler):
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o output_name
    ```
3.  Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```

## 🤝 Contributing

As this is a personal learning journey, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you spot a bug, have a suggestion, or want to discuss a concept, feel free to **open an issue**!
