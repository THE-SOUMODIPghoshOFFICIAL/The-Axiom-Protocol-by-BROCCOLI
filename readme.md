## 💻 Compiling & Running

Each module is self-contained. To compile and run a specific piece of code:

1.  Navigate into the module's directory:
    ```bash
    cd 01_the_Basics/some_concept_folder
    ```
2.  Compile the C file using `gcc` (or any C compiler):
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o output_name
    ```
3.  Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```
