# THE-LIBRARY

Welcome to THE-LIBRARY — a curated shelf for your C books and study materials. This folder holds the reference texts, example code, and notes you use while learning or teaching C.

Contents

- [C Primer Plus — 6th Ed (Stephen Prata)](CPrimerPlus_6ed-BYStephenPrata/)
- [Let Us C — 19th Ed (Yashavant Kanetkar)](LET-US-C-19edBY-Yashavant%20Kanetkar/)

What this folder is for

- Keep original book files, scans, and official example code here.
- Add your shortnotes, solved exercises, and small demos next to each book.
- Use a subfolder named `notes/` inside each book folder for summaries and cheatsheets.

Quick tips

- To compile examples (Windows + MinGW or WSL):

  gcc example.c -o example.exe

- Recommended editor: Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extension.
- Put practice projects in a `projects/` subfolder so they stay separate from raw book files.


License & notes
